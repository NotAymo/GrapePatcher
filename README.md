# Inkay - Aroma patches for Grape

Inkay is an Aroma/WUPS plugin that patches various Nintendo Network URLs on a Wii U to use Pretendo Network instead. It also (for the time being) bypasses SSL verification in most cases.

Inkay does not currently include the game-specific patches present in [Nimble](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble). These will be implemented soonâ„¢.

# Note from Aymo

Project grape is in beta. It shouldn't brick your Wii U.
Its made for https://grape.helioho.st/ but the original Inkay is at https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay
You can't compile without [Devkitpro](https://devkitpro.org) and [Wut](https://github.com/devkitPro/wut).
The WPS file will be added in a later date.
## Dependencies
Inkay is only supported on the release version of Aroma configured for autoboot/coldboot. For Tiramisu, see [Nimble](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble).

## Safety
Inkay's patches are all temporary, and only applied in-memory without modifying your console. The SSL patch, while also temporary, could reduce the overall security of your console while active - this is because it no longer checks if a server is verified. However, this does not apply to the Internet Browser, where SSL still works as expected.

## TODO
See [Issues](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay/issues).
